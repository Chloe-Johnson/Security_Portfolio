## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Ansible Playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

This document contains the following details:

- Access Policies

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- Filebeat is used to collect log files from very specific files, such as logs generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, or MySQL databases.
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address |    Operating System     |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux Ubuntu 18.04-LTS  |
| Web1 VM  |Webserver | 10.0.0.5   | Linux Ubuntu 18.04-LTS  |
| Web2 VM  |Webserver | 10.0.0.6   | Linux Ubuntu 18.04-LTS  |
| Web3 VM  |Webserver | 10.0.0.7   | Linux Ubuntu 18.04-LTS  |

### Access Policies

The virtual machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box VM machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- Personal workstation IP 24.11.45.xx

Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible |    Allowed IP Addresses                                   |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | Personal IP, 10.1.0.4, 10.0.0.0/16,                       |
| Web1     | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 10.1.0.4                                        |
| Web2     | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 10.1.0.4                                        |
| Web3     | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 10.1.0.4                                        |
| ElkStack | Yes                 | Personal IP, 10.1.0.4 (HTTP:5601), 10.0.0.4 (Jumpbox SSH) |


### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

*The playbook implements the following tasks:

- **Install docker.io**: The Docker engine, used for running containers.

- **Install python3-pip** This is the package manager used to install Python Software

- **Install docker** (this is the Docker Python pip module)

- **Increase Virtual Memory** This increases virtual memory in the Elk container

- **Download and Launch Elk Docker Container** This will download and start the sepb/elk:716 container on the Elk machine. Published ports include 5601:Kibana, 9200:Elastic Search, 5044:Filebeat.

-**Enable Docker System Service on Boot** This tells Docker to enable on boot-up.




The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1VM 10.0.0.5 
- Web-2VM 10.0.0.6 
- Web-3VM 10.0.0.7

I have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat- Monitors the log files on Web-1VM, Web-2VM, Web-3VM collects log events, and forwards them to Elasticsearch for indexing
- Metricbeat- Installed on the ELK server to periodically collect metrics from the operating system and from services running on the server.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat configuration file to /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml 
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include [elk] 10.1.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ELK GUI http://10.1.0.4:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected. 
   -Navigate to Module Status
   -Click on Check Data
   -Scroll to bottom and click on Verify Incoming Data

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- Which file is the playbook? filebeat-playbook.yml 
- Where do you copy it? on the ELK server at: /etc/ansible/roles/filebeat-playbook.yml
- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? Ansible configuration file at :/etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml 
- How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? In the configuration file on the ELK machineFilebeat is built to collect data about specific files on remote machines, it must be installed on the VMs you want to monitor   
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://10.1.0.4:5601/app/kibana

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._

Command to download Filebeat Configuration File:
-run: curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slape/5cc350109583af6cbe577bbcc0710c93/raw/eca603b72586fbe148c11f9c87bf96a63cb25760/Filebeat >> /etc/ansible/filebeat-config.yml

Edit Filebeat Configuration File Template to include the IP address of ELK machine 
-run: nano /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
   -Edit line 1106 to include ELK IP & port- hosts: ["10.1.0.4:9200"]
   -Edit line 1806 to include ELK Ip & port- host: "10.1.0.4:5601"

Create Ansible playbook installation instructions
-run: nano /etc/ansible/roles/filebeat-playbook.yml

Run Ansible playbook to install Filebeat on DVWA machines
-run: ansible-playbook filebeat-playbook.yml
